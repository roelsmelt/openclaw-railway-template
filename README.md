# OpenClaw Railway Template (1‑click deploy)

This repo packages **OpenClaw** for Railway with a small **/setup** web wizard so users can deploy and onboard **without running any commands**.

## What you get

- **OpenClaw Gateway + Control UI** (served at `/` and `/openclaw`)
- A friendly **Setup Wizard** at `/setup` (protected by a password)
- Optional **Web Terminal** at `/tui` for browser-based TUI access
- Persistent state via **Railway Volume** (so config/credentials/memory survive redeploys)

## How it works (high level)

- The container runs a wrapper web server.
- The wrapper protects `/setup` with `SETUP_PASSWORD`.
- During setup, the wrapper runs `openclaw onboard --non-interactive ...` inside the container, writes state to the volume, and then starts the gateway.
- After setup, **`/` is OpenClaw**. The wrapper reverse-proxies all traffic (including WebSockets) to the local gateway process.

## Getting chat tokens (so you don't have to scramble)

### Telegram bot token

1. Open Telegram and message **@BotFather**
2. Run `/newbot` and follow the prompts
3. BotFather will give you a token that looks like: `123456789:AA...`
4. Paste that token into `/setup`

### Discord bot token

1. Go to the Discord Developer Portal: https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. **New Application** → pick a name
3. Open the **Bot** tab → **Add Bot**
4. Copy the **Bot Token** and paste it into `/setup`
5. Invite the bot to your server (OAuth2 URL Generator → scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`; then choose permissions)

## Web Terminal (TUI)

The template includes an optional web-based terminal that runs `openclaw tui` in your browser.

### Enabling

Set `ENABLE_WEB_TUI=true` in your Railway Variables. The terminal is **disabled by default**.

Once enabled, access it at `/tui` or via the "Open Terminal" button on the setup page.

### Security

The web TUI implements multiple security layers:

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Opt-in only** | Disabled by default, requires explicit `ENABLE_WEB_TUI=true` |
| **Password protected** | Uses the same `SETUP_PASSWORD` as the setup wizard |
| **Single session** | Only 1 concurrent TUI session allowed at a time |
| **Idle timeout** | Auto-closes after 5 minutes of inactivity (configurable via `TUI_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`) |
| **Max duration** | Hard limit of 30 minutes per session (configurable via `TUI_MAX_SESSION_MS`) |

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ENABLE_WEB_TUI` | `false` | Set to `true` to enable |
| `TUI_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `300000` (5 min) | Closes session after inactivity |
| `TUI_MAX_SESSION_MS` | `1800000` (30 min) | Maximum session duration |

## Local testing

```bash
docker build -t openclaw-railway-template .

docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -e PORT=8080 \
  -e SETUP_PASSWORD=test \
  -e ENABLE_WEB_TUI=true \
  -e OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=/data/.openclaw \
  -e OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR=/data/workspace \
  -v $(pwd)/.tmpdata:/data \
  openclaw-railway-template

# Setup wizard: http://localhost:8080/setup (password: test)
# Web terminal: http://localhost:8080/tui (after setup)
```

## FAQ

**Q: How do I access the setup page?**

A: Go to `/setup` on your deployed instance. When prompted for credentials, use the generated `SETUP_PASSWORD` from your Railway Variables as the password. The username field is ignored—you can leave it empty or enter anything.

**Q: I see "gateway disconnected" or authentication errors in the Control UI. What should I do?**

A: Go back to `/setup` and click the "Open OpenClaw UI" button from there. The setup page passes the required auth token to the UI. Accessing the UI directly without the token will cause connection errors.

**Q: I don't see the TUI option on the setup page.**

A: Make sure `ENABLE_WEB_TUI=true` is set in your Railway Variables and redeploy. The web terminal is disabled by default.

**Q: How do I approve pairing for Telegram or Discord?**

A: Go to `/setup` and use the "Approve Pairing" dialog to approve pending pairing requests from your chat channels.

**Q: How do I change the AI model after setup?**

A: Use the OpenClaw CLI to switch models. Access the web terminal at `/tui` (if enabled) or SSH into your container and run:

```bash
openclaw models set provider/model-id
```

For example: `openclaw models set anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514` or `openclaw models set openai/gpt-4-turbo`. Use `openclaw models list --all` to see available models.
